# COMP-ACL
The full analysis pipeline used to extract spatiotemporal gait parameters from the Xsens MVNX files is openly available on GitHub under an MIT license at: https://github.com/tomeryona/COMPWALK-ACL-gait-analysis.
This code includes functions for parsing MVNX files, detecting gait events, computing gait speed, cadence, step and stride lengths, and trimming trials to remove acceleration/deceleration phases. It supports batch analysis of the full dataset structure as described in the Data Records section. Users can adapt the code for their own MVNX-based IMU datasets.
